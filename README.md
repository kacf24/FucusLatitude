# ASV Database

Our custom ASV Database was created by considering sequences from the summer (2015, 2016) *Fucus vesiculosus*, rock scrapings, and water column samples (all 3 deposited under BIOPROJECT ID PRJNA658993), *Fucus spralis* and *Fucus distichus* (Only from Schoodic ME; BIOPROJECT PENDING), Porphyra umbilicalis (BIOPROJECT PENDING), and fall (2015, 2016) *Fucus vesiculosus* (BIO PROJECT PENDING). Details of sampling and methodoloy are described in a submitted manuscript, except a 5,000 read cut-off across all samples was used to define an ASV (The microbiome of a habitat-forming brown alga, *Fucus vesiculosus*, has similar cross-Atlantic structure and drivers***submitted***).
